    <hr>
    <div style="color:aliceblue; font-size: larger;">
    <h3>QUESTION 1:</h3>
    <pre><b>The features of HTML5 are:
        <ul>
            <li>Semantic Elements</li>
            <li>Audio and Video Support</li>
            <li>Canvas Elements</li>
            <li>Responsive Images</li>
            <li>Local Storage</li>
        </ul>
    </b></pre>
    <hr>         
    <h3>QUESTION 2:</h3>
    <pre><b>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). 
Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). 
You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.

Some of the entities are:

<ul>
    <li>& reg ; (&reg;)	Interpreted as the registered sign.</li>
    <li>& trade ; (&trade;)	Interpreted as the trademark sign.</li>
    <li>& ne ; (&ne;)	Interpreted as not equal to sign.</li>
    <li>& pound ; (&pound;	Interpreted as the pound symbol.</li>
    <li>& deg ; (&deg;)	Interpreted as the degree symbol.</li>
    <li>& copy ; (&copy;)	Interpreted as the copyright sign.</li>
</ul></b></pre>

    <h3>QUESTION 3:</h3>
    <pre><b>Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web,
by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.

Some of the assistive tools are:

<ul>
    <li>Refreshable Braille display – a mechanical terminal that displays a line of Braille characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins) dynamically. 
Braille devices with capabilities of small computers incorporate Braille displays. 
These devices can be used to take notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as public information kiosks.</li>
    <li>Screen reader – software that processes content on the desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as text-to-speech and Braille. 
Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud.</li>
    <li>Voice browser – similar to screen reader but usually only processes web content. 
Voice browsers are typically not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for mobile devices or similar.</li>
</ul></b></pre>

    <h3>QUESTION 4:</h3>
    <pre><b>Some of the ways to make a website accessible:
        <ul>
            <li>Add Images with Alt Text.</li>
            <li>Allow Users to Enlarge Font Sizes.</li>
            <li>Keep Contrast Sensitivity in Mind.</li>
            <li>Add Keyboard Navigation.</li>
            <li>Use Descriptive URLs.</li>
        </ul>
    </b></pre>
    <hr>
    <h3>QUESTION 5:</h3>
    <pre><b>The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable (usually with the Tab key, hence the name),
and determine their relative ordering for sequential focus navigation.
It accepts an integer as a value, with different results depending on the integer's value:
<ul>
    <li>A negative value (the exact negative value doesn't actually matter, usually tabindex="-1"),
means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation.</li>
    <li>tabindex="0" means that the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, after any positive tabindex values. 
The focus navigation order of these elements is defined by their order in the document source.</li>
    <li>A positive value means the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, 
with its order defined by the value of the number.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>QUESTION 6:</h3>
    <pre><b>
        <ul>
            <li>The < section > element defines a section in a document.

                According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
                
                Examples of where a < section > element can be used:
                
                -Chapters
                -Introduction
                -News items
                -Contact information
                -A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.</li>
            <li>The < article > element specifies independent, self-contained content.

                An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
                
                Examples of where the < article > element can be used:
                
                -Forum posts
                -Blog posts
                -User comments
                -Product cards
                -Newspaper articles</li>
            <li>The < header > element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

                A < header > element typically contains:
                
                -one or more heading elements (< h1 > - < h6 >)
                -logo or icon
                -authorship information

                Note: You can have several < header > elements in one HTML document. However, < header > cannot be placed within a < footer >, < address > or another < header > element.</li>
            <li>The < footer > element defines a footer for a document or section.

                A < footer > element typically contains:
                
                -authorship information
                -copyright information
                -contact information
                -sitemap
                -back to top links
                -related documents

                You can have several < footer > elements in one document.</li>
            <li>The < aside > element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The < aside > content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>QUESTION 7:</h3>
    <pre><b>Using Semantic tags structures the content of our webpage.
It may not matter to the user, but to the browsers.
It is considered to be a good practice for SEO and web-accesibility.
